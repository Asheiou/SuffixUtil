SuffixUtil v${version}

You are now the proud owner of a SuffixUtil! Unless you're running this on an AeoliaLib
architecture, I don't know why you have it, but hello anyway. config.yml is as so:
enabled: whether to automatically give a player a suffix on join
suffixes: a list of suffixes to give. This should be the LuckPerms group name.

C'est tout ! bye.
